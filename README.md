# ToDoTs
ToDo app using TypeScript.

In my ToDo App you have two lists of projects, active projects list and finished project list.
</br>
If you finished your project you can drag it to the finished project list.
</br>
</br>
- This project allows me to practice all great features that TypeScript provides to developers.</br>
- Another new experience is using drag and drop interaction on website.</br>
- I also learned about Webpack configuration for development and production.
